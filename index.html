                Healthy eating can mean a lot of different things. For some of us it means incorporating more low-carb
                or Whole30-friendly meals into our weekly routine. For others it's all about following a Mediterranean
                diet or committing to meal prep and eating more plant-based foods. However you define it and put it into
                practice, we can all agree on two things: healthy eating nourishes us and fills our plates with plenty
                of wholesome ingredients.

            <p class="lp-para"> When the weather gets warm there’s nothing we love more than having a sweet, frozen
                treat.
                It doesn’t matter
                if
                it’s homemade ice cream or an over-the-top, layered ice cream cake — we’ll gladly gobble it up. Heck,
                we’ve
                even
                been known to eat ice pops for breakfast.

                <p> Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Arrange the short ribs in a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and season
                    with
                    salt and pepper, to taste. In a small bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients and stir to
                    incorporate. Pour the sauce over ribs and toss well, coating all the pieces.
